# **Install**
Install this package with **`npm i connectfourai`** or **`npm install connectfourai`**.

# **Setup**
```js
// Load the module and store it in a variable.
const AI = require("connectfourai");
```

# **Usage**
```js
const AI = require("connectfourai");

// To start a new game.
AI.new_game();

// To see the board.
AI.display_board();

// Makes a move for the player. Note that columns are 0-indexed, so if you want the first column then use 0, and if you want the last column use 6.
AI.play_human(4);

// Makes a move for the AI.
AI.play_ai();
AI.play_ai(2); /* You can also specify a column for the AI to play in. */
// You can also specify a depth to play against. The higher the number, the longer the bot will take to calculate. A depth of 9 is suggested.
AI.play_ai(null, 4);

// To check if a column can be played.
AI.can_play(3);

// To see which columns can be played in.
AI.get_valid_locations();

// To see which column is the best for a human to play. Can be used as a hint.
AI.get_best_move();
AI.get_best_move(5); /* You can specify a depth as well */
```

AI.set("columns", 10);          // Minimum 3
AI.set("rows", 9);              // Minimum 3
AI.set("depth", 5);             // Minimum 1, default 9. Change here to not have to specify as an argument later.

// You can setup a specific position. The board is setup by placing a piece in each column, from left-to-right.
AI.set_pos("4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,6");

// Get the current position.
AI.get_pos();
